# Day Planner

The goal of this project was to create a simple Day planner calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. The app operates in your browser using dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Each day, the app will update with the current date at the top of the page and will display a green text area for every hour that has not yet occured in the day. For the current hour of the day, the app will display a red text area and for any past hour, a grey text area. If text is present, the user can click the blue save button which will then locally store the text which will still display upon a page refresh. This app is helps the user manage their business hours effectively.
